            <p>Go. Wow, you must be rich. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Save the clock tower. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium.</p>

            <p>Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? You'll find out. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? I think I know exactly what you mean.</p>

            <p>I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. I hope so. Of course I do.

Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Uncle Jailbird Joey? Doc, is that a de-</p>

            <p>Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Oh. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? What's the meaning of this.</p>
