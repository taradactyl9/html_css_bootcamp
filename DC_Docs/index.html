                    This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone. Um, I'm happy you're home. Oh... candy, leftovers, Eggo's... she really likes Eggo's. Why are you keeping this curiosity door lock?

                <blockquote>If anyone asks where I am, I've left the country. So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? It’s about the shadow monster, isn’t it? Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. Friends don't lie. You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to.

                    This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone. She shut one door! With her mind! You are such a nerd. No wonder you only hang out with boys. She shut one door! With her mind! Mistakes have been made.

                    <h5>CAMPUS INFO</h5>
                    No... no El, you're not the monster. You saved me. Do you understand? You saved me. It’s finger-lickin’ good. Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks? Specifically how to build one? You act like you want me to be your friend and then you treat me like garbage.
